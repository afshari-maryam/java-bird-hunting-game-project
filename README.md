# java-bird-hunting-game-project
A simple Java game project for programming class.  It is a very simple 2D shooter game.


Minimum Criteria:

You are expected to design the game by using java. Below are the minimal criteria:

Proper object oriented (OO) hierarchy (E.g. Creatures, cannon types can be implemented that way. Use concepts of interfaces, abstract classes while designing OO hierarchy)
Mouse or Key listeners (at least one of them to control your gun)
Minimal GUI elements ( Minimal a button, a check box and a text field)
Graphics (Java 2D API usage while designing your graphical elements)
Animation (Creatures must move or when they die, there can be some animation)
Create a jar file
High Score (Keep user high scores for only recent games. Show it in a GUI element, e.g. list box. You do NOT have to save it on disk and load it.)
